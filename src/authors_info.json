    "bio": "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specialising in Old and Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of the world which he called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng. Lit. establishment, with honourable exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s he was taken up by many members of the nascent \"counter-culture\" largely because of his concern with environmental issues. In 1997 he came top of three British polls, organised respectively by Channel 4 / Waterstone's, the Folio Society, and SFX, the UK's leading science fiction media magazine, amongst discerning readers asked to vote for the greatest book of the 20th century. \r\n\r\n([Source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html",

      "value": "Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born in Torquay, Devon, in the United Kingdom, the daughter of a wealthy American stockbroker. Her father died when she was eleven years old. Her mother taught her at home, encouraging her to write at a very young age. At the age of 16, she went to Mrs. Dryden's finishing school in Paris to study singing and piano. In 1914, at age 24, she married Colonel Archibald Christie, an aviator in the Royal Flying Corps. While he went away to war, she worked as a nurse and wrote her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920), which wasn't published until four years later. When her husband came back from the war, they had a daughter. In 1928 she divorced her husband, who had been having an affair. In 1930, she married Sir Max Mallowan, an archaeologist and a Catholic. She was happy in the early years of her second marriage, and did not divorce her husband despite his many affairs. She travelled with her husband's job, and set several of her novels set in the Middle East. Most of her other novels were set in a fictionalized Devon, where she was born.\r\n\r\nAgatha Christie is credited with developing the \"cozy style\" of mystery, which became popular in, and ultimately defined, the Golden Age of fiction in England in the 1920s and '30s, an age of which she is considered to have been Queen. In all, she wrote over 66 novels, numerous short stories and screenplays, and a series of romantic novels using the pen name Mary Westmacott. She was the single most popular mystery writer of all time. In 1971 she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire."

    "bio": "Russian novelist Fyodor Mikhailovitch Dostoyevsky was a journalist and short-story writer, whose psychological penetration into the human soul profoundly influenced the 20th century novel. Dostoevsky's novels have much autobiographical elements, but ultimately they deal with moral and philosophical questions. He presented interacting characters with contrasting views or ideas about freedom of choice, Socialism, atheisms, good and evil, happiness and so forth. Dostoevsky's central obsession was God, whom his characters constantly search through painful errors and humiliations. ([Source][1])\r\n\r\nDostoyevsky's literary output explores human psychology in the troubled political, social and spiritual context of 19th-century Russian society. Considered by many as a founder or precursor of 20th-century existentialism, his *Notes from Underground* (1864), written in the embittered voice of the anonymous \"underground man\", was called by Walter Kaufmann the \"best overture for existentialism ever written.\" A prominent figure in world literature, Dostoyevsky is often acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest psychologists in world literature.

([Source][3])\r\n\r\nКак в начале, так и в продолжении своего литературного творчества после четырёх лет каторги и ссылки за участие в кружке Петрашевского Достоевский выступал в качестве новатора в русле традиций русского реализма, что не получило должной оценки современников при жизни писателя. ([Source][3])\r\n\r\nПосле смерти Достоевский был признан классиком русской литературы и одним из лучших романистов мирового значения, считается первым представителем персонализма в России. Творчество русского писателя оказало воздействие на мировую литературу, в частности, на творчество ряда лауреатов Нобелевской премии по литературе, на становление экзистенциализма и фрейдизма. ([Source][3])\r\n\r\nК наиболее значительным произведениям писателя относятся романы «великого пятикнижия». Романы «Преступление и наказание», «Идиот», «Бесы» и «Братья Карамазовы» включены в список 100 лучших книг Норвежского книжного клуба 2002 года. Многие известные произведения Достоевского многократно экранизировались и инсценировались в театре, ставились балетные и оперные постановки.

    "bio": "Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American writer and journalist. During his lifetime he wrote and had published seven novels; six collections of short stories; and two works of non-fiction. Since his death three novels, four collections of short stories, and three non-fiction autobiographical works have been published. Hemingway received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.\r\n\r\nHemingway was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school he worked as a reporter but within months he left for the Italian front to be an ambulance driver in World War I. He was seriously injured and returned home within the year. He married his first wife Hadley Richardson in 1922 and moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent. During this time Hemingway met, and was influenced by, writers and artists of the 1920s expatriate community known as the \"Lost Generation\". In 1924 Hemingway wrote his first novel, The Sun Also Rises.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1920s, Hemingway divorced Hadley, married his second wife Pauline Pfeiffer, and moved to Key West, Florida. In 1937 Hemingway went to Spain as a war correspondent to cover the Spanish Civil War. After the war he divorced Pauline, married his third wife Martha Gellhorn, wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls, and moved to Cuba. Hemingway covered World War II in Europe and he was present at Operation Overlord. Later he was in Paris during the liberation of Paris. After the war, he divorced again, married his fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway, and wrote Across the River and Into the Trees. Two years later, The Old Man and the Sea was published in 1952. Nine years later, after moving from Cuba to Idaho, he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.\r\n\r\nHemingway produced most of his work between the mid 1920s and the mid 1950s, though a number of unfinished works were published posthumously. Hemingway's distinctive writing style is characterized by economy and understatement, and had a significant influence on the development of twentieth-century fiction writing. His protagonists are typically stoical men who exhibit an ideal described as \"grace under pressure.\" Many of his works are now considered classics of American literature. During his lifetime, Hemingway's popularity peaked after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea.

    "bio": "Gabriel García Márquez is a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter and journalist. García Márquez, affectionately known as \"Gabo\" throughout Latin America, is considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha; they have two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.\r\n\r\nHe started as a journalist, and has written many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude.

Among many volumes of poetry, Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles stand particularly high in critical esteem, and Hugo is sometimes identified as the greatest French poet. Outside France, his best-known works are the novels Les Misérables and Notre-Dame de Paris (known in English also as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame).\r\n\r\nThough a committed conservative royalist when he was young, Hugo grew more liberal as the decades passed; he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, and his work touches upon most of the political and social issues and artistic trends of his time. He is buried in the Panthéon.\r\n\r\n([Source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo",

    "bio": "An Irish writer, poet, and prominent aesthete.\r\n\r\nOscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was an Irish playwright, poet, and author of numerous short stories, and one novel. Known for his biting wit, and a plentitude of aphorisms, he became one of the most successful playwrights of the late Victorian era in London, and one of the greatest celebrities of his day. Several of his plays continue to be widely performed, especially The Importance of Being Earnest.\r\n\r\nAs the result of a widely covered series of trials, Wilde suffered a dramatic downfall and was imprisoned for two years hard labour after being convicted of \"gross indecency\" with other men. After Wilde was released from prison he set sail for Dieppe by the night ferry. He never returned to Ireland or Britain, and died in poverty.",

Verne wrote about space, air, and underwater travel before navigable aircraft and practical submarines were invented, and before any means of space travel had been devised. Consequently he is often referred to as the \"Father of science fiction\", along with H. G. Wells.

He then lived with his mother, in reduced financial security, until her institutionalization in 1919. He began to write essays for the United Amateur Press Association, and in 1913 wrote a critical letter to a pulp magazine that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction. He became active in the speculative fiction community and was published in several pulp magazines. Lovecraft moved to New York City, marrying Sonia Greene in 1924, and later became the center of a wider group of authors known as the \"Lovecraft Circle\". They introduced him to Weird Tales, which would become his most prominent publisher. Lovecraft's time in New York took a toll on his mental state and financial conditions. He returned to Providence in 1926 and produced some of his most popular works, including *The Call of Cthulhu*, *At the Mountains of Madness*, *The Shadow over Innsmouth* and *The Shadow Out of Time*. \r\nHe would remain active as a writer for 11 more years until his death from intestinal cancer at the age of 46. \r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia."

Although his exact date of birth is uncertain, Asimov himself celebrated it on January 2.  His family emigrated to Brooklyn, New York and opened a candy store when he was three years old.  He taught himself to read at the age of five. He began reading the science fiction pulp magazines that his family's store carried. Around the age of eleven, he began to write his own stories, and by age nineteen, he was selling them to the science fiction magazines. He graduated from Columbia University in 1939. He married Gertrude Blugerman in 1942.  During World War II he worked as a civilian at the Philadelphia Navy Yard's Naval Air Experimental Station.  After the war, he returned to Columbia University and earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1948.  He then joined the faculty of the Boston University School of Medicine until 1958, when he became a full-time writer. His first novel, [Pebble in the Sky](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL46402W), was published in 1950. He and his wife divorced in 1973, and he married Janet O. Jeppson the same year. He was a highly prolific writer, having written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 9,000 letters and postcards.",

His best-known and most beloved books, *The Martian Chronicles*, *The Illustrated Man*, *Fahrenheit 451* and *Something Wicked This Way Comes*, are masterworks that readers carry with them over a lifetime.

    "bio": "Virginia Woolf  was an English novelist, essayist, diarist, epistler, publisher, feminist, and writer of short stories, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary  figures of the twentieth century. ([Source][1].)\r\n\r\n[Comment from Ursula Le Guin on The Guardian][2]:\r\n\r\n> You can't write science fiction well if you haven't read it, though not all who try to write it know this. But nor can you write it well if you haven't read anything else. Genre is a rich dialect, in which you can say certain things in a particularly satisfying way, but if it gives up connection with the general literary language it becomes a jargon, meaningful only to an ingroup. Useful models may be found quite outside the genre. I learned a lot from reading the ever-subversive Virginia Woolf.\r\n\r\n> I was 17 when I read [Orlando][3]. It was half-revelation, half-confusion to me at that age, but one thing was clear: that she imagined a society vastly different from our own, an exotic world, and brought it dramatically alive. I'm thinking of the Elizabethan scenes, the winter when the Thames froze over. Reading, I was there, saw the bonfires blazing in the ice, felt the marvellous strangeness of that moment 500 years ago – the authentic thrill of being taken absolutely elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> How did she do it? By precise, specific descriptive details, not heaped up and not explained: a vivid, telling imagery, highly selected, encouraging the reader's imagination to fill out the picture and see it luminous, complete.\r\n\r\n> In [Flush][4], Woolf gets inside a dog's mind, that is, a non-human brain, an alien mentality – very science-fictional if you look at it that way. Again what I learned was the power of accurate, vivid, highly selected detail. I imagine Woolf looking down at the dog asleep beside the ratty armchair she wrote in and thinking what are your dreams? and listening . . . sniffing the wind . . . after the rabbit, out on the hills, in the dog's timeless world.\r\n\r\n> Useful stuff, for those who like to see through eyes other than our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf\r\n  [2]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/14/science-fiction-authors-choice\r\n  [3]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39360W/Orlando\r\n  [4]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL39320W/Flush",

Η Ιλιάδα αποτελείται από 15.693 στίχους και αναφέρεται στις τελευταίες πενήντα μία, αποφασιστικής σημασίας ημέρες του πολέμου της Τροίας, ο οποίος συνολικά διήρκεσε, σύμφωνα με τον μύθο, 10 χρόνια. Η Οδύσσεια αποτελείται από 12.110 στίχους και περιγράφει τον δεκαετή αγώνα του Οδυσσέα για τον νόστο (επιστροφή στην πατρίδα του Ιθάκη μετά την κατάληψη της Τροίας).\r\n\r\nΗ γλώσσα των κειμένων είναι η ομηρική ελληνική, μια λογοτεχνική γλώσσα με ανάμειξη χαρακτηριστικών από την ιωνική και την αιολική διάλεκτο με κύρια επιρροή την ανατολική ιωνική διάλεκτο. Πολλοί ερευνητές πιστεύουν ότι αρχικά τα ποιήματα μεταδόθηκαν προφορικά.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nHomer (Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος) was an ancient Greek author and epic poet. He is the reputed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, the two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential authors of all time. The Homeric epics were the greatest influence on ancient Greek culture and education. From antiquity until the present day, the influence of Homeric epic on Western civilization has been great, inspiring many of its most famous works of literature, music, art and film.\r\n\r\nThe poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic. Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks generally believed that Homer was an historical individual, but modern scholars are skeptical: no reliable biographical information has been handed down from classical antiquity, and the poems themselves manifestly represent the culmination of many centuries of oral story-telling and a well-developed \"formulaic\" system of poetic composition. According to Martin West, \"Homer\" is \"not the name of a historical poet, but a fictitious or constructed name.\"",

A fifth, unfinished novel, *The Love of the Last Tycoon* was published posthumously. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with despair and age.

He is best known for his ongoing *A Song of Ice and Fire* series of epic fantasy novels.\r\n\r\nCritics have described Martin's work as dark and cynical. His first novel, Dying of the Light, set the tone for most of his future work; it is set on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story, and many of Martin's others, have a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy, or at least unsatisfied - trying to stay idealistic in a ruthless world. Many have elements of tragic heroes in them. Reviewer T. M. Wagner writes, \"Let it never be said Martin doesn't share Shakespeare's fondness for the senselessly tragic.\" This gloominess can be an obstacle for some readers. The Inchoatus Group writes, \"If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you’re looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n([Source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin",

He is often referred to as \"the god father\" of modern drama and is one of the founders of Modernism in the theatre.[1] His plays were considered scandalous to many of his era, when Victorian values of family life and propriety largely held sway in Europe. Ibsen's work examined the realities that lay behind many facades, possessing a revelatory nature that was disquieting to many contemporaries. It utilized a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. Ibsen is often ranked as one of the truly great playwrights in the European tradition, alongside Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nSource and more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen"

Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. Chekhov was a physician by profession. \"Medicine is my lawful wife\", he once said, \"and literature is my mistress.\""

She and her three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and May, were educated by their father, philosopher and teacher Bronson Alcott, and raised on the practical Christianity of their mother, Abigail May.\r\n\r\nLouisa spent her childhood in Boston and in Concord, Massachusetts, where her days were enlightened by visits to Ralph Waldo Emerson’s library, excursions into nature with Henry David Thoreau, and theatricals in the barn at \"Hillside\".\r\n\r\nLike her character, \"Jo March\" in Little Women, young Louisa was a tomboy.  \"No boy could be my friend till I had beaten him in a race,\" she claimed, \"and no girl if she refused to climb trees, leap fences ...\"\r\n\r\nFor Louisa, writing was an early passion.  She had a rich imagination and often her stories became melodramas that she and her sisters would act out for friends.  Louisa preferred to play the \"lurid\" parts in these plays --\"the villains, ghosts, bandits, and disdainful queens.\"\r\n\r\nAt age 15, troubled by the poverty that plagued her family, she vowed:   \"I will do something by and by.  Don’t care what, teach, sew, act, write -- anything to help the family; and I’ll be rich and famous and happy before I die, see if I won’t!\"",

He worked at a Custom House and joined a Transcendentalist Utopian community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before returning to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, leaving behind his wife and their three children.\r\n\r\nMuch of Hawthorne's writing centers around New England and many feature moral allegories with a Puritan inspiration. His work is considered part of the Romantic movement and includes novels, short stories, and a biography of his friend, the United States President Franklin Pierce."

After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence. ([Source][1].)\r\n\r\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson"

Η Ιλιάδα αποτελείται από 15.693 στίχους και αναφέρεται στις τελευταίες πενήντα μία, αποφασιστικής σημασίας ημέρες του πολέμου της Τροίας, ο οποίος συνολικά διήρκεσε, σύμφωνα με τον μύθο, 10 χρόνια. Η Οδύσσεια αποτελείται από 12.110 στίχους και περιγράφει τον δεκαετή αγώνα του Οδυσσέα για τον νόστο (επιστροφή στην πατρίδα του Ιθάκη μετά την κατάληψη της Τροίας).\r\n\r\nΗ γλώσσα των κειμένων είναι η ομηρική ελληνική, μια λογοτεχνική γλώσσα με ανάμειξη χαρακτηριστικών από την ιωνική και την αιολική διάλεκτο με κύρια επιρροή την ανατολική ιωνική διάλεκτο. Πολλοί ερευνητές πιστεύουν ότι αρχικά τα ποιήματα μεταδόθηκαν προφορικά.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nHomer (Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος) was an ancient Greek author and epic poet. He is the reputed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, the two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential authors of all time. The Homeric epics were the greatest influence on ancient Greek culture and education. From antiquity until the present day, the influence of Homeric epic on Western civilization has been great, inspiring many of its most famous works of literature, music, art and film.\r\n\r\nThe poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic. Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks generally believed that Homer was an historical individual, but modern scholars are skeptical: no reliable biographical information has been handed down from classical antiquity, and the poems themselves manifestly represent the culmination of many centuries of oral story-telling and a well-developed \"formulaic\" system of poetic composition. According to Martin West, \"Homer\" is \"not the name of a historical poet, but a fictitious or constructed name.\"",

Coelho dropped out of law school in 1970 and traveled through South America, Mexico, North Africa, and Europe. In 1972 he returned home and began writing pop and rock music lyrics with Raul Seixas, a well-known Brazilian singer and songwriter. He worked for Polygram and CBS Records until 1980, when he embarked on new travels in Europe and Africa.\r\n\r\nIt was during this trip that he walked the route of Santiago de Compostela, which formed the basis of his first book, *O diário de um mago* (1987), which was published in English as *The Diary of a Magus* in 1992 and was reissued as *The Pilgrimage* in 1995. In 1988 Coelho published *O alquimista* (*The Alchemist*), which ultimately became an international best-seller. His other notable works include *The Valkyries*, *Eleven Minutes*, *Manual of The Warrior of Light*, *Manuscript Found in Accra*, *The Devil and Miss Prym*, *The Fifth Mountain*, *Veronika Decides to Die*, and *The Zahir*.\r\n\r\nSource: [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paulo-Coelho)"

      "value": "Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges (Buenos Aires, 24 de agosto de 1899 - Ginebra, 14 de junio de 1986), más conocido como Jorge Luis Borges, fue un destacado escritor de cuentos, poemas y ensayos argentino, extensamente considerado una figura clave tanto para la literatura en habla hispana como para la literatura universal. También fue bibliotecario, profesor, conferencista y traductor. Sus dos libros más conocidos, *Ficciones* y *El Aleph,* publicados en los años cuarenta, son recopilaciones de cuentos conectados por temas comunes de forma fantástica, como los sueños, los laberintos, las bibliotecas, los espejos, los autores ficticios y las mitologías europeas (como la griega y la nórdica), con argumentos que exploran ideas filosóficas relacionadas, por ejemplo, con la memoria, la eternidad, la posmodernidad y la metaficción. Las obras de Borges han contribuido ampliamente a la literatura filosófica, al género fantástico y al posestructuralismo. Según marcan numerosos críticos, el comienzo del realismo mágico en la literatura hispanoamericana del siglo XX se debe en gran parte a su obra."

Su primera novela, *La casa de los espíritus* (1985), que surgió directamente de su exilio, se convirtió en un éxito de ventas y crítica mundial. A menudo entreteje elementos de mito y realismo, o lo que se conoce como \"realismo mágico\".

Several months after her uncle's assassination and the overthrow of Chile's coalition government in 1973, Allende left Chile and found refuge in Venezuela. Her first novel, The House of the Spirits (1985), which arose directly out of her exile, became a worldwide bestseller and critical success. She often weaves together elements of myth and realism, or what is known as \"magic realist.\" Her novels are sometimes based on her own childhood and life experiences. Allende has been called \"the world's most widely read Spanish-language author.\""

    "bio": "Yukio Mishima (三島 由紀夫) was the pen name of Kimitake Hiraoka (平岡 公威), a Japanese author, poet and playwright, also remembered for his ritual suicide by seppuku.\r\n\r\nAt age six, Mishima enrolled in elite Peers School (Gakushuin 学習院). At 12, Mishima began to write his first stories. He read voraciously the works of Oscar Wilde, Rainer Maria Rilke and numerous classic Japanese authors. After six years at school, he became the youngest member of the editorial board in its literary society. Mishima was attracted to the works of Tachihara Michizō, which in turn created an appreciation for the classical form of the waka. Mishima's first published works included waka poetry, before he turned his attention to prose.\r\n\r\n([Source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima",

    "birth_date": "8 February 1955",
    "bio": "Long before his name became synonymous with the modern legal thriller, he was working 60-70 hours a week at a small Southaven, Mississippi, law practice, squeezing in time before going to the office and during courtroom recesses to work on his hobby—writing his first novel.\r\n\r\nBorn on February 8, 1955 in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to a construction worker and a homemaker, John Grisham as a child dreamed of being a professional baseball player. Realizing he didn’t have the right stuff for a pro career, he shifted gears and majored in accounting at Mississippi State University. After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. In 1983, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1990.\r\n\r\nOne day at the DeSoto County courthouse, Grisham overheard the harrowing testimony of a twelve-year-old rape victim and was inspired to start a novel exploring what would have happened if the girl’s father had murdered her assailants. Getting up at 5 a.m. every day to get in several hours of writing time before heading off to work, Grisham spent three years on A Time to Kill and finished it in 1987. Initially rejected by many publishers, it was eventually bought by Wynwood Press, who gave it a modest 5,000 copy printing and published it in June 1988.\r\n\r\nThat might have put an end to Grisham’s hobby. However, he had already begun his next book, and it would quickly turn that hobby into a new full-time career—and spark one of publishing’s greatest success stories. The day after Grisham completed A Time to Kill, he began work on another novel, the story of a hotshot young attorney lured to an apparently perfect law firm that was not what it appeared. When he sold the film rights to The Firm to Paramount Pictures for $600,000, Grisham suddenly became a hot property among publishers, and book rights were bought by Doubleday. Spending 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, The Firm became the bestselling novel of 1991.\r\n\r\nThe successes of The Pelican Brief, which hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and The Client, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham’s reputation as the master of the legal thriller. Grisham’s success even renewed interest in A Time to Kill, which was republished in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Dell. This time around, it was a bestseller.\r\n\r\nSince first publishing A Time to Kill in 1988, Grisham has written one novel a year (his other books are The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror, The Broker, Playing for Pizza, The Appeal, and The Associate) and all of them have become international bestsellers. There are currently over 250 million John Grisham books in print worldwide, which have been translated into 29 languages. Nine of his novels have been turned into films (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, A Painted House, The Runaway Jury, and Skipping Christmas), as was an original screenplay, The Gingerbread Man. The Innocent Man (October 2006) marked his first foray into non-fiction, and Ford County (November 2009) was his first short story collection.\r\n\r\nGrisham lives with his wife Renee and their two children Ty and Shea. The family splits their time between their Victorian home on a farm in Mississippi and a plantation near Charlottesville, VA.\r\n\r\nGrisham took time off from writing for several months in 1996 to return, after a five-year hiatus, to the courtroom. He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer: representing the family of a railroad brakeman killed when he was pinned between two cars. Preparing his case with the same passion and dedication as his books’ protagonists, Grisham successfully argued his clients’ case, earning them a jury award of $683,500—the biggest verdict of his career.\r\n\r\nWhen he’s not writing, Grisham devotes time to charitable causes, including most recently his Rebuild The Coast Fund, which raised 8.8 million dollars for Gulf Coast relief in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He also keeps up with his greatest passion: baseball. The man who dreamed of being a professional baseball player now serves as the local Little League commissioner. The six ballfields he built on his property have played host to over 350 kids on 26 Little League teams.",

Brown's novels, which are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour time period, feature the recurring themes of cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into over 40 languages, and as of 2009, sold over 80 million copies.\r\n\r\nBrown's novels that feature the lead character Robert Langdon also include historical themes and Christianity as recurring motifs, and as a result, have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian, though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' himself, and says of his book *The Da Vinci Code* that it is simply \"an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate\" and suggests that the book may be used \"as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith.\"\r\n\r\n([Source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown",

    "bio": "Brandon Sanderson (born December 19, 1975) is an American author known for his intricate and imaginative works in the genres of fantasy and science fiction. Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Sanderson developed a passion for writing at a young age. He attended Brigham Young University, where he studied English and later earned a master's degree in creative writing.\r\n\r\nSanderson is best known for creating the Cosmere, a vast fictional universe that encompasses many of his fantasy novels, where they share subtle connections and a common mythology, including the *Mistborn* series and *The Stormlight Archive*. The *Mistborn* trilogy, starting with the novel [*Mistborn: The Final Empire*][3], is a thrilling fantasy heist story set in a dystopian world ruled by a tyrannical lord. *The Stormlight Archive*, starting with the novel [*The Way of Kings*][8], is an epic fantasy series that combines political intrigue, war, and extensive world-building.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his work within the Cosmere, Sanderson completed [Robert Jordan's][4] epic fantasy series \"The Wheel of Time\" after Jordan's passing. He has also authored several young adult series, such as *The Reckoners* and the *Skyward* series.\r\n\r\nSanderson's analytical approach to world-building includes his \"Sanderson's Laws of Magic,\" which distinguish between \"hard\" and \"soft\" magic systems in fantasy literature. His ability to create immersive worlds and compelling characters has earned him a dedicated fan base and numerous accolades, including the Hugo Award in 2013 for his novella [*The Emperor's Soul*][5], the Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Award for his novels [*Elantris*][6] in 2005, and [The Hero of Ages][7] in 2008, as well as David Gemmell Legend Awards in 2011 for [*The Way of Kings*][8] and in 2015 for [*Words of Radiance*][9]. In 2022, Sanderson's Kickstarter campaign for four secret novels became the most successful in history, raising over $41 million.\r\n\r\nAs of 2022, he is a co-creator and former host of the *Writing Excuses* podcast, an educational podcast for writers by writers that was started in 2008.\r\n\r\n(Sources: [1][1],[2][2])\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/hello-my-names-brandon\r\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson\r\n[3]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5738148W\r\n[4]: https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL233594A\r\n[5]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19960448W\r\n[6]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5738147W\r\n[7]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5738154W\r\n[8]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15358691W\r\n[9]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16813053W",

    "bio": "James Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 – September 16, 2007), known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was an American author known for his epic fantasy series *The Wheel of Time*. Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Jordan developed a passion for storytelling and served two tours in Vietnam before pursuing a writing career in 1977.\r\n\r\nJordan is best known for *The Wheel of Time*, a sprawling fantasy saga that combines intricate world-building, complex characters, and a richly detailed magic system. The series spans fourteen books and a prequel novel, with the first volume, [*The Eye of the World*][1], published in 1990. The narrative explores themes of prophecy, destiny, and the struggle between good and evil, set in a meticulously crafted world with its own history, cultures, and languages.\r\n\r\nAfter Jordan's passing in 2007, fellow fantasy author [Brandon Sanderson][2] was chosen to complete the series using Jordan's extensive notes and outlines. The final three books were published between 2009 and 2013, bringing the epic saga to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nJordan was one of several writers who contributed to the *Conan the Barbarian* series, with his works considered among the best by fans. He wrote seven Conan novels, and compiled a well-known Conan Chronology.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his fantasy writing, Jordan used various pseudonyms for different genres: Reagan O'Neal for historical novels set during the American Revolution, Jackson O'Reilly for a western novel, and Chang Lung for his dance and theater criticism.\r\n\r\nJordan's ability to create immersive worlds and compelling characters has earned him a dedicated fan base and numerous accolades. His work on *The Wheel of Time* series has sold over 90 million copies worldwide and was adapted into a television series by Amazon Prime Video in 2021.\r\n\r\nHis favorite authors included: [Robert A. Heinlein][7], [John D. MacDonald][8], [Louis L'Amour][9], [Jane Austen][10], [Charles Dickens][11], [Mark Twain][12], and [Montaigne][13].\r\n\r\nFantasy authors he enjoyed included: [Tad Williams][14], [Robert Holdstock][15], [Raymond E.

    "bio": "Albert Camus was a French Algerian author, philosopher, and journalist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. He was a key philosopher of the 20th-century and his most famous work is the novel *L'Étranger* (*The Stranger*).\r\n\r\nIn 1949, Camus founded the Group for International Liaisons within the Revolutionary Union Movement, which was a group opposed to some tendencies of the surrealistic movement of André Breton. Camus was the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature - after Rudyard Kipling - when he became the first African-born writer to receive the award. He is the shortest-lived of any literature laureate to date, having died in an automobile accident just over two years after receiving the award.\r\n\r\nHe is often cited as a proponent of existentialism, the philosophy that he was associated with during his own lifetime, but Camus himself rejected this particular label. In an interview in 1945, Camus rejected any ideological associations: \"No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked…\"",

    "bio": "Samuel Barclay Beckett was an Irish avant-garde writer, dramatist and poet, writing in English and French. Beckett's work offers a bleak outlook on human culture and both formally and philosophically became increasingly minimalist in his later career.\r\n\r\nAs a student, assistant, and friend of James Joyce, Beckett is considered one of the last modernists; as an inspiration to many later writers, he is sometimes considered one of the first postmodernists. He is also considered one of the key writers in what Martin Esslin called \"Theatre of the Absurd.\" As such, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nBeckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969 for his \"writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation\". Beckett was elected Saoi of Aosdána in 1984. He died in Paris of respiratory problems. ([Source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett",

In addition to his work as a poet, Hughes was a novelist, columnist, playwright, and essayist, and though he is most closely associated with Harlem, his world travels influenced his writing in a profound way. Langston Hughes followed the example of Paul Laurence Dunbar, one of his early poetic influences, to become the second African American to earn a living as a writer. His long and distinguished career produced volumes of diverse genres and inspired the work of countless other African American writers.\r\n--From Gale Cengage Learning Free resources",

    "bio": "An American science fiction writer, one of the best-known among the few African-American women in the field.\r\n\r\n[Comment by Tricia Sullivan, on The Guardian][1]:\r\nOctavia E Butler (1947–2006)\r\n\r\n> I was teaching in New York when I came across Octavia E Butler's Kindred in a secondary-school catalogue of novels recommended to support diversity. It caught my attention because Butler was described as a science-fiction writer. I thought I was familiar with science fiction, but I'd never heard of her – nor have a great many other readers, I suspect. For many years, Butler was the sole African-American woman novelist in science fiction. Kindred tells the wrenching and unforgettable story of a young black woman who time-travels and saves the life of her slaveholder ancestor, but it is, in Butler's words, \"a grim fantasy\", not science fiction.\r\n\r\n> Beginning in the 1970s, Butler wrote three sequences of novels: the Patternist books, the Lilith's Brood series and the Parable novels (incomplete at her tragic death in 2006). Critically respected, she won the Hugo and Nebula awards, received a Clarke nomination, the PEN lifetime achievement award and a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant. A serious writer working in a field that is seldom taken seriously, Butler addressed biological control, gender, humanity's relationship with aliens, genetics and even the development of a fictional religion. Her narratives leave space for the reader's involvement while exploring the nature of change. They gaze unflinchingly on power dynamics. \"Who will rule? Who will lead? Who will define, refine, confine, design? Who will dominate? All struggles are essentially power struggles,\" Butler stated, \"and most are no more intellectual than two rams knocking their heads together.\" Butler's writing is courageous, stimulating and infused with a rare purity of intention. Crushingly, she died at the height of her powers. [Bloodchild and Other Stories][2] is a good place to begin discovering her work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/14/science-fiction-authors-choice\r\n  [2]: http://openlibrary.org/works/OL35621W/Bloodchild_and_other_stories",

    "bio": "Henry Beam Piper was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in 1904, and died, an apparent suicide, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in 1964.  Piper's first published story, \"Time and Time Again\" (Astounding Science Fiction, April 1947), was adapted for radio and aired on the NBC program Dimension X on 12 July, 1951, and again on the NBC program X Minus One on 11 January, 1956.  His historical essay \"Rebel Raider,\" published in True: The Men's Magazine in 1950, inspired the fictional teleplay Willie and the Yank, a three-part mini-series which aired on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color in January 1967 (and was later released theatrically as Mosby's Marauders).  His first novel was the 1953 mystery Murder in the Gunroom and his science-fiction novel Little Fuzzywas nominated for a Hugo Award in 1963.  Piper made his living working for the Pennsylvania Railroad and was a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the New York Authors' Club, and the Hydra Club. \r\n\r\nPiper occasionally attended the annual World Science Fiction Convention, attending the 1957 WorldCon in London with his wife.  He also attended the 1962 WorldCon in Chicago and the 1963 WorldCon in Washington, DC. \r\n\r\nAfter Piper's death, the intellectual property rights to his fiction were acquired by Ace Books (now an imprint owned by Penguin Random House).  The late author Jerry Pournelle was granted the right by Piper himself (and acknowledged by Ace) to publish stories set in Piper's fictional settings but, despite decades-long rumors of a sequel to Space Viking, apparently decided not to take advantage of this opportunity.  In the early 1980's, Ace commissioned two sequels to Piper's Fuzzy novels, William Tuning's Fuzzy Bones and Ardath Mayhar's Golden Dream: A Fuzzy Odyssey, before Piper's own unpublished sequel, Fuzzies and Other People, was discovered (by Piper's protegé of sorts, Mike Knerr) and published (by Ace) in 1984.  More recently, John Scalzi wrote Fuzzy Nation, an officially-authorized \"reboot\" of Little Fuzzy. \r\n\r\nAuthor and Piper biographer John F. Carr, who edited four collections of Piper's short stories also published by Ace in the 1980's, has authored several sequels to Piper's Paratime novel Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen and more recently has written other novels set both in Piper's Paratime and Terro-human Future History settings.  Carr has also edited The Rise of the Terran Federation, an anthology of Piper's early Terro-human Future History yarns and new, Piper-inspired stories of the same era written by others.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.zarthani.net",

    "bio": "Roald Dahl was a British novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter.\r\n\r\nBorn in north Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegian parents, Dahl served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, in which he became a flying ace and intelligence agent. He rose to prominence in the 1940s with works for both children and adults, and became one of the world's bestselling authors. His short stories are known for their unexpected endings, and his children's books for their unsentimental, often very dark humour.

    "bio": "Helen Beatrix Potter (28 July 1866 – 22 December 1943) was an English writer, illustrator, natural scientist, and conservationist. She is best known for her children's books featuring animals, such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit, which was her first published work in 1902. Her books, including 23 Tales, have sold more than 250 million copies. Potter was also a pioneer of merchandising—in 1903, Peter Rabbit was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy, making him the oldest licensed character.\r\n\r\nBorn into an upper-middle-class household, Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children. She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District, developing a love of landscape, flora and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted. Potter's study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology. In her thirties, Potter self-published the highly successful children's book The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Following this, Potter began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.\r\n\r\nPotter wrote over 60 books; the best known being her twenty-three children's tales. With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt, in 1905 Potter bought Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey, a village in the Lake District, in the county of Cumbria (then Lancashire). Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from Hawkshead. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children's books for British publisher Warne until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.\r\n\r\nPotter died of pneumonia and heart disease on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at the age of 77, leaving almost all her property to the National Trust. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the Lake District National Park. Potter's books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in songs, films, ballet, and animations, and her life is depicted in two films and a television series.",

In 1920, his son, Christopher Robin Milne, was born. In 1925, Milne moved to a country home called Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex.\r\n\r\nWinnie-the-Pooh, Milne's most famous work, was published in 1926. Although he had his greatest success with his books for children, he stopped writing works for children by the end of the decade, saying that the source of his inspiration for children's stories, his son, had grown older. He continued to write works for adults, although he was frustrated to find that these works were not nearly as popular as his children's books.\r\n\r\nMilne retired to Cotchford Farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid, and he died in 1956."

His early works, such as Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka, were heavily influenced by his Ukrainian upbringing and identity. His more mature writing satirised the corrupt bureaucracy of the Russian Empire, leading to his exile. On his return, he immersed himself in the Orthodox Church. The novels *Taras Bul'ba* (1835; 1842 [revised edition]) and *Dead Souls* (1842), the play *The Inspector-General* (1836, 1842), and the short stories *Diary of a Madman*, *The Nose* and *The Overcoat* (1842) are among his best known works. With their scrupulous and scathing realism, ethical criticism as well as philosophical depth, they remain some of the most important works of world literature."

    "bio": "Gorky, Maxim or Maksim [Rus.,=Maxim the Bitter], pseud. of Aleksey Maximovich Pyeshkov, 1868-1936, Russian writer. Gorky is considered the father of Soviet literature and the founder of the doctrine of socialist realism.\r\n\r\nInstilled by his grandmother with a love of romantic tales and great sympathy for mankind, Gorky began a nomadic life at 12, wandering the Volga area. Since the czar's schools were closed to peasants, he educated himself, an experience he describes in My Universities (1923). He held dozens of menial jobs, publishing his first story in 1892. Gorky then became a journalist and married a colleague on the Samarskaya Gazeta. His articles exposed local corruption and he soon lost his job.\r\n \r\nIn 1898 Gorky's collection Sketches and Stories was published by a radical press and the author was an immediate sensation. These romantic tales concern the vigor and nobility of the Russian peasants and workers. About 1900 he turned to writing novels of social realism. Of these, Mother (1906) had the greatest impact on Soviet literature. Describing the awakening of revolutionary feeling in an ill-treated peasant woman, it became the prototype of the revolutionary novel. At this time Gorky became close friends with Leo Tolstoy and Chekhov, about both of whom he later wrote superb Reminiscences (tr. 1946).\r\n \r\nGorky donated most of his income to the revolutionary movement. He was arrested frequently but treated carefully because of his tremendous popularity. The czar rescinded his election to the Academy of Sciences in 1902, whereupon Chekhov and Korolenko resigned in protest. Gorky wrote 15 plays, two of which, heavily censored, were enormously successful at the Moscow Art Theatre. One of them, The Lower Depths (1902), a study of the wretched lives of derelicts, remains a classic. His plays, at first modeled on Chekhov's, emphasized characterization over plot.\r\n \r\nAfter the failure of the 1905 revolution, in which he took part, Gorky sought to raise funds for the movement abroad. Following an initial triumphant reception in the United States (1906), he was insulted and mistreated there because his traveling companion was a woman who was not his wife. Settling in Capri (1906-13), he set up a Bolshevik propaganda school before he returned to Russia in 1914.\r\n \r\nAlthough philosophically at odds with Lenin, Gorky was able to extract from him aid for many intellectuals and artists in an era of intellectual restriction. Exhausted from his work as head of the State Publishing House and by bouts with tuberculosis, he sought rest abroad (1921) and returned in 1928. His final, unfinished work, often considered his masterpiece, is The Life of Klim Samgin (1927-36), a panoramic four-volume novel of Russian social conditions from 1880 to 1917. Gorky's death at 68 has been ascribed to assassination by poison, perpetrated according to one view by an anti-Soviet group.\r\n \r\nGorky's work was remarkable for its vitality and optimism. It revealed, within its devotion to realism, a strong poetic strain and an eternal passion for justice. By the example of his work and life and by his literary criticism Gorky exerted a profound influence on Soviet thought. Most of his works have been translated.\r\n\r\n[Columbia Encyclopedia][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.answers.com/topic/maxim-gorky",

    "bio": "Natsuo Kirino (born in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture) is the pen name of Mariko Hashioka, a Japanese novelist and a leading figure in the recent boom of female writers of Japanese detective fiction.\r\n\r\nKirino is the middle child of three. She has two brothers, one who is six years older and one who is five years younger. Her father was an architect. Kirino has lived in many different cities, including her current residence, Tokyo. Kirino married in 1975 and had a daughter in 1981.\r\n\r\nShe earned a law degree in 1974 from Seikei University, and she dabbled in many fields of work before settling on being a writer. For example, not knowing what she wanted to do in life, Kirino began working at the Iwanami Hall movie theater in her early twenties. She soon discovered it wasn't right for her and just before her thirtieth birthday she started taking scriptwriting classes. It wasn't until she was in her thirties that she began to seriously think about becoming a writer, and it wasn't until her forties that she became popular as a writer. - Wikipedia",

    "bio": "Keigo Higashino(東野 圭吾) is one of the most popular and biggest selling fiction authors in Japan—as well known as James Patterson, Dean Koontz or Tom Clancy are in the USA.\r\n\r\nBorn in Osaka, he started writing novels while still working as an engineer at Nippon Denso Co.(presently DENSO). He won the Edogawa Rampo Prize, which is awarded annually to the finest mystery work, in 1985 for the novel Hōkago (After School) at age 27. Subsequently, he quit his job and started a career as a writer in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, he won the Mystery Writers of Japan Inc award for the novel Himitsu (The Secret), which was translated into English by Kerim Yasar and published by Vertical under the title of Naoko in 2004. In 2006, he won the 134th Naoki Prize for Yōgisha X no Kenshin. His novels had been nominated five times before winning with this novel.\r\n\r\nThe Devotion of Suspect X was the second highest selling book in all of Japan— fiction or nonfiction—the year it was published, with over 800,000 copies sold. It won the prestigious Naoki Prize for Best Novel— the Japanese equivalent of the National Book Award and the Man Booker Prize. Made into a motion picture in Japan, The Devotion of Suspect X spent 4 weeks at the top of the box office and was the third highest‐grossing film of the year.\r\n\r\nHigashino’s novels have more movie and TV series adaptations than Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum, and as many as Michael Crichton. \r\n\r\nSource: Goodreads.com",

Co-founder of the Hong Kong daily Ming Pao, which he started in 1959, he was the paper's first editor-in-chief.\r\n\r\nCha's fiction, which is of the Wuxia (\"martial arts and chivalry\") genre, has a widespread following in Chinese-speaking areas, including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and the United States. His fifteen works written between 1955 and 1972 earned him a reputation as one of the finest Wuxia writers ever. He is currently the best-selling Chinese author alive; over 100 million copies of his works have been sold worldwide (not including unknown number of bootleg copies).\r\n\r\nCha's works have been translated into Korean, English, Japanese, French, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Burmese and Thai. He has many fans abroad as well, owing to the numerous adaptations of his works into films, television series, manhua (comics) and video games.<sup>[1][1]</sup>\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong",

    "bio": "Patricia Highsmith (January 19, 1921 – February 4, 1995) was an American novelist and short story writer widely known for her psychological thrillers, including her series of five novels featuring the character Tom Ripley.\r\n\r\nShe wrote 22 novels and numerous short stories throughout her career spanning nearly five decades, and her work has led to more than two dozen film adaptations. Her writing derived influence from existentialist literature, and questioned notions of identity and popular morality. She was dubbed \"the poet of apprehension\" by novelist Graham Greene.\r\n\r\nHer first novel, *Strangers on a Train*, has been adapted for stage and screen, the best known being the Alfred Hitchcock film released in 1951. Her 1955 novel *The Talented Mr. Ripley* has been adapted for film. Writing under the pseudonym **Claire Morgan**, Highsmith published the first lesbian novel with a happy ending, *The Price of Salt*, in 1952, republished 38 years later as Carol under her own name and later adapted into a 2015 film. \r\n\r\n**Source**: [Patricia Highsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Highsmith) on Wikipedia",

In the 1970s he moved to Norway, where he lived with a woman who was a member of the Maoist Communist Labour Party, although he never officially joined the Party. He moved to Africa and lived in several African countries, and in 1985 he founded the Avenida Theater in Maputo, Mozambique, where he continues to spend about half of every year. In 1997 he began his most well-known series of novels, a series of murder mysteries set in Ystad, Sweden, featuring the police detective Kurt Wallander. He also established a publishing house, Leopard Förlag, to publish young talents from both Africa and Sweden. He is married to Eva Bergman, daughter of Ingmar Bergman."

    "bio": "Frank Morrison Spillane, better known as Mickey Spillane, was an American author of crime novels, many featuring his signature detective character, Mike Hammer. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. In 1980, Spillane was responsible for seven of the top 15 all-time best-selling fiction titles in the United States.\r\n\r\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Spillane was the only child of his Irish bartender father, John Joseph Spillane, and his Scottish mother, Catherine Anne. Spillane attended Erasmus Hall High School, graduating in 1935. He started writing while in high school, briefly attended Fort Hays State College in Kansas and worked a variety of jobs, including summers as a life-guard at Breezy Point, Queens, and a period as a trampoline artist for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Spillane enlisted in the Army Air Corps, becoming a fighter pilot and a flight instructor.\r\n\r\nMickey and Mary Ann Spillane had four children (Caroline, Kathy, Michael, Ward), and their marriage ended in 1962. In November 1965, he married his second wife, nightclub singer Sherri Malinou. After that marriage ended in divorce (and a lawsuit) in 1983, Spillane shared his waterfront house in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, with his third wife, Jane Rogers Johnson, whom he married in October 1983, and her two daughters (Jennifer and Margaret Johnson).\r\n\r\nIn 1989, Hurricane Hugo ravaged his Murrells Inlet house to such a degree it had to be almost entirely reconstructed. A television interview showed Spillane standing in the ruins of his house. He received an Edgar Allan Poe Grand Master Award in 1995. Spillane's novels went out of print, but in 2001, the New American Library began reissuing them.\r\n\r\nSpillane died July 17, 2006 at his home in Murrells Inlet, of pancreatic carcinoma. After his death, his friend and literary executor, Max Allan Collins, began the task of editing and completing Spillane's unpublished typescripts, beginning with a Mike Hammer novel, *The Goliath Bone* (2008).\r\n\r\nWriting career\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n###Comic books\r\n\r\nSpillane started as a writer for comic books. While working as a salesman in Gimbels department store basement in 1940, he met tie salesman Joe Gill, who later found a lifetime career in scripting for Charlton Comics. Gill told Spillane to meet his brother, Ray Gill, who wrote for Funnies, Inc., an outfit that packaged comic books for different publishers. Spillane soon began writing an eight-page story every day. He concocted adventures for major 1940s comic book characters, including Captain Marvel, Superman, Batman and Captain America. Two-page text stories, which he wrote in the mid-1940s for Timely, appeared under his name and were collected in *Primal Spillane* (Gryphon Books, 2003).\r\n\r\n###Novels\r\n\r\nSpillane joined the United States Army Air Forces on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the mid-1940s he was stationed as a flight instructor in Greenwood, Mississippi, where he met and married Mary Ann Pearce in 1945. The couple wanted to buy a country house in the Newburgh, New York, 60 miles north of New York City, so Spillane decided to boost his bank account by writing a novel. In 19 days he wrote *I, the Jury*. At the suggestion of Ray Gill, he sent it to E. P. Dutton.\r\n\r\nWith the combined total of the 1947 hardcover and the Signet paperback (December 1948), *I, the Jury* sold six and a half million copies in the United States alone. *I, the Jury* introduced Spillane's most famous character, hard-boiled detective Mike Hammer. Although tame by current standards, his novels featured more sex than competing titles, and the violence was more overt than the usual detective story. An early version of Spillane's Mike Hammer character, called Mike Danger, was submitted in a script for a detective-themed comic book. \" 'Mike Hammer' originally started out to be a comic book. I was gonna have a Mike Danger comic book,\" [Spillane] said in a 1984 interview. Two Mike Danger comic-book stories were published in 1954 without Spillane's knowledge, as well as one featuring Mike Lancer (1942), were published with other material in *Byline: Mickey Spillane*, edited by Max Allan Collins and Lynn F. Myers, Jr. (Crippen & Landru publishers, 2004).\r\n\r\nThe Signet paperbacks displayed dramatic front cover illustrations. Lou Kimmel did the cover paintings for *My Gun Is Quick*, *Vengeance Is Mine*, *One Lonely Night* and *The Long Wait*. The cover art for *Kiss Me, Deadly* was by James Meese. *--Wikipedia*",

He was fired in 1995 at the age of 40 as a result of corporate restructuring. Always a voracious reader, he decided to see an opportunity where others might have seen a crisis and bought six dollars' worth of paper and pencils and sat down to write a book, Killing Floor, the first in the (now 15 book) Jack Reacher series.\r\n\r\n-- from leechild.com"

    "bio": "Maeve Binchy was born on 28 May 1940 in Dalkey, County Dublin, Ireland, the eldest child of four. Her parents were very positive and provided her with a happy childhood. Despite the fact she describes herself as an overweight child it was her parents attitude that gave her the confidence to accept herself for who she is today. \r\n\r\nShe studied at University College Dublin and was a teacher for a while. She also loved travelling and this was how she found her niche as a writer. She liked going to all different kinds of places such as a Kibbutz in Israel and worked in a camp in the United States. It was whilst she was away that she sent letters home to her parents. They were so impressed with these chatty letters from all over the world that they decided to send them to a newspaper. They were published. She left teaching and became a journalist. She still writes columns today.\r\n\r\nMaeve married Gordon Snell who is also a published writer. When they were struggling financially it was then that Light a Penny Candle was published. She became an overnight success. Her books deal with relationship problems. Many of them are set in the past in Ireland such as \"Echoes\" and often deal with people who are young, fall in love, have families then have relationship or family problems that readers can identify with. The main characters are people you can empathise with. Some of her later novels have been brought forward to the present day to become more modern. Her cousin Dan Binchy is also a published writer.\r\n\r\nShe passed away on 30 July 2012, at the age of 72.",

    "death_date": "4 July 1974",
    "bio": "Georgette Heyer was born on 16 August 1902 in Wimbledon, London, England, UK. She was the eldest child of Sylvia Watkins and George Heyer; her brother George Boris was born four years later, and her brother Frank nine years later. During her childhood, the family lived also in Paris, France, but they returned to England before World War I. During the war, her father served as a requisitions officer for the British Army in France. Her father encouraged her to read, he never forbade her any book. At 17, she began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris, who suffered from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and \"The Black Moth\" was released in 1921.\r\n\r\nIn December 1920, she met George Ronald Rougier, a young man two years older than she, who studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. They became engaged the spring of 1925. By then she had published five novels. Only one month later, her father died of a heart attack, and, as he left no pension for his family, she assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. On 18 August 1925, Georgette married George Ronald, but two months later, he was sent to Caucasus Mountains, and she remained at home and continued to write. She released \"These Old Shades\", during the midst of the UK General Strike of 1926; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. The novel sold 190,000 copies, and she refused for the rest of her life to promote her novels. Her husband was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika, and she joined him in 1927. They moved to Macedonia in 1928, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family, and the following year they returned to England.\r\n\r\nIn England, her husband started different businesses, but she was always the primary breadwinner. They had a son, Richard, and she continued to care for her brothers and mother. During the World War II, her husband and brothers served in the army, and to earn more money, she reviewed books for Heinemann. To minimize her tax liability, she formed a limited liability company, that paid salaries for her and her family. The tax inspectors discovered financial problems with the company, which she finally sold. \r\n\r\nHeyer wrote principally historical romance novels and some detective novels. She essentially established the historical sub-genre of Regency romance, inspired by Jane Austen's work. Unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, she collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life, becoming an expert. Her successful regency novels were imitated by many other authors, and in some cases were allegedly plagiarized, but she chose not to file lawsuits. She continued writing until her death by lung cancer on 4 July 1974; her novel My Lord John, the first and only book of the Lancaster Trilogy, was published posthumously.",

    "bio": "Daphne du Maurier was born on 13 May 1907 in London, England, United Kingdom, the second of three daughters of Muriel Beaumont, an actress and maternal niece of William Comyns Beaumont, and Sir Gerald du Maurier, the prominent actor-manager, son of the author and Punch cartoonist George du Maurier, who created the character of Svengali in the novel Trilby. She was also the cousin of the Llewelyn Davies boys, who served as J.M. Barrie's inspiration for the characters in the play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up. As a young child, she met many of the brightest stars of the theatre, thanks to the celebrity of her father. These connections helped her in establishing her literary career, and she published some of her early stories in Beaumont's Bystander magazine. Her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published in 1931, and she continued writing successfull gothic novels in addition to biographies and other non-fiction books. Alfred Hitchcock was a fan of her novels and short stories, and adapted some of these to films: Jamaica Inn (1939), Rebecca (1940), and The Birds (1963). Other of her works adapted were Frenchman's Creek (1942), Hungry Hill (1943), My Cousin Rachel (1951), and \"Don't Look Now\" (1973). She was named a Dame of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nIn 1932, she married Frederick \"Boy\" Browning, with whom she had three children, Tessa, Flavia and Christian. Her husband died in 1965, and she passed away on 19 April 1989 in Fowey, Cornwall. After her death, it was revealed that she was bisexual.",

      "value": "William Wilkie Collins (8 January 1824 – 23 September 1889) was an English novelist, playwright and short story writer best known for *The Woman in White* (1859) and *The Moonstone* (1868). The last has been called the first modern English detective novel. Born to the family of a painter, William Collins, in London, he grew up in Italy and France, learning French and Italian. He began work as a clerk for a tea merchant. After his first novel, Antonina, appeared in 1850, he met Charles Dickens, who became a close friend and mentor. Some of Collins's works appeared first in Dickens's journals *All the Year Round* and *Household Words* and they collaborated on drama and fiction. Collins achieved financial stability and an international following with his best known works in the 1860s, but began suffering from gout. Taking opium for the pain grew into an addiction. In the 1870s and 1880s his writing quality declined with his health. Collins was critical of the institution of marriage: he split his time between Caroline Graves and his common-law wife Martha Rudd, with whom he had three children.\r\n\r\n**Source**: [Wilkie Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkie_Collins) on Wikipedia."

    "bio": "\"Anna Sewell was born in 1820 and died in 1878. She was lame from childhood and spent most of her life as a semi-invalid living at Brighton where her father had a position as a Bank Manager. Her mother wrote several moral tales in verse for children. Anna wrote only one book, Black Beauty, which was published 1877, and which sold over 100,000 copies in the first twenty years. It has been translated into French, Italian, German and has been described as 'one of themost successful animal stories ever written.\"\r\n(Biographical note from <i>\"Black Beauty\"</i>, Blackie & Son Ltd., Glasgow, ca 1950s.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Mary and Anna Sewell**\r\n----------\r\n**By Diana Kennedy**\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n> *This article was originally published in the August 2001 edition of Soul\r\n> Search, the journal of The Sole\r\n> Society.*\r\n\r\nBoth Mary Sewell nee Wright and her daughter Anna were authors. Mary, less well known today was a popular author of juvenile best sellers, writing stories with titles such as “Mother’s Last Words”, “Our Father’s Care” and “Thy Poor Brother”. Mary was a deeply religious woman, with a sensitive and artistic nature, who was until 1835 a Quaker. She was also a member of the Anti-Slavery Association. Her daughter Anna was the author of the well known children’s classic ‘Black Beauty’, a fictional autobiography of a thoroughbred horse. Her aim in writing the book was to “induce kindness, sympathy and an understanding treatment of horses”. The book has a strong moral purpose and is said to have been instrumental in the abolition of the cruel practice of using the checkrein . The book was recommended by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\r\n\r\nMary Wright was born 6th April 1797 at Sutton, Suffolk, the daughter of John Wright a gentleman farmer and Ann nee Holmes. Ann was the daughter of John Holmes of Tivetshall, Norfolk. Mary Wright married Isaac Sewell on 15th June 1819 at Lamas, Norfolk after a five year courtship. Isaac was the youngest of twelve children of William and Hannah Maria nee Fuller was born 25th September 1793 at Great Yarmouth. His father William was the second of eight children of Abraham and Mary Sewell.\r\n\r\nIsaac and Mary’s daughter Anna was baptised at Great Yarmouth on 30th March 1820.\r\n\r\nA few days after Anna’s birth Isaac discovered that he had been swindled in a business venture, leaving him in financial difficulties. With the help of Quaker Friends the family moved to a little house and shop off Bishopsgate Street in London opposite a gin palace. Unfortunately Isaac had been badly advised and soon after the birth of his son Phillip in 1822, the family found themselves in further financial difficulties. The family then moved to Dalston, where they were to spend the next ten years.\r\n\r\nIt was at Dalston that Mary Sewell’s first little book was published, a book of verses which were written with the object of inculcating moral virtues in all relations of her life. Mary taught her children at home and writing helped her to earn money to buy books for her children’s education. Later Anna was to attend a day boarding school. Mary trained her children to find glory rather than degradation in work, and work became an outlet for the high spirited Anna. It was a happy time for the family at Dalston, although it was here that returning from school one day Anna fell and sprained both her ankles severely. Despite medical attention Anna became more and more crippled, and was to spend much of her life confined to home. However she was always cheerful and thoughtful towards others, despite her problems.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Isaac moved to Brighton with his family to become the manager of the London and County Bank. It was here that her parents hoped to find a cure for Anna. A doctor bled her profusely, but she steadily grew more crippled. She does however write in her journal in 1844 of walks with her friends and visits to London to see art galleries. She herself was a gifted artist. Anna also had a love of nature and delighted in visiting her grandparents at Buxton, just outside Norwich, which fostered her love of the countryside. The census of 1851 shows Anna and her brother Phillip both at Buxton, Norfolk. Anna was staying with her Grandfather John Wright, whilst Phillip was with their Uncle John Wright. Phillip was to inherit the Manor of Brampton from his uncle in 1871 and was able to buy the manor of Buxton his grandparent's place. His two spinster daughters later gave Sewell Park to the corporation of Norwich.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Isaac moved his family to Lancing and it was probably here that Anna’s love of horses developed. A pony chaise was purchased and Anna drove her father to and from Shoreham station. The following year Mary took her family to Germany for a holiday, and Anna was left there for treatment that helped her to walk. Isaac retired form the bank in 1857 and in the autumn of that year the family visited Santander in Spain. On their return they settled at Blue Lodge in Wick near Bath and Bristol. It was at Wick that Mary’s main works were published with Anna assisting her mother in the work. ‘Homely Ballads’ was published for private circulation in 1858 but by 1889 40,000 copies had been sold. ‘Mothers Last Words’ a story of two boys kept from evil courses by their mothers last words sold 1,088,000 copies. It had a simplicity of language which made her writing popular. ‘Stories in Verse’ a collection of her poems was published in 1861. The family was at Wick until 1867 when they moved back to Norfolk settling at Old Catton near Norwich.\r\n\r\nAnna SewellAnna first mentioned that she was writing Black Beauty in her journal on 6th November 1871. She wrote “I am writing the life of a horse, and getting dolls and boxes ready for Christmas”. In December 1876 she wrote, “I am getting on with my little book ‘Black Beauty’.” By this time Anna was becoming more and more crippled and was confined to the house spending much of her time on a sofa writing in pencil, with her mother making a copy. She wrote “I have been confined to the house and to my sofa, from time to time, when I am able, been writing what I think will turn out a little book, its special aim being to induce kindness, sympathy and an understanding treatment of horses”. Black Beauty was published at the end of 1877 and Anna lived just long enough to hear of its success. She died in April 1878. ‘Black Beauty’ went on to sell over 100,000 copies by 1894 and was translated into French, German, and Italian.\r\n\r\nAnna was buried in the Quaker burying ground at Lamas near Norwich. Her father Isaac died 7th November 1878 at Old Catton. Mary died 10th June 1884 and was also buried at Lamas despite having left the Quakers in about 1835 for the Church of England. In 1886 Mary’s ‘Poems and Ballads’ was published in two volumes ",

Mr. Hodgson sold brass goods to upper class households, and the family had a maid, a nurse-maid, and a horse and carriage.  However, in the early 1850's when Frances was only three or four years old, her father died of a stroke, and the family was forced to sell their house and move. Her mother carried on the business, and Frances was often left in the care of her grandmother, who taught her to read.

Det var i köket hos lagårdskarlens dotter Edit Astrid fick höra den saga som först väckte hennes läshunger – en lust till böcker som varade livet igenom.\r\n\r\nI skolan är Astrid duktig på att skriva och blir kallad för Vimmerbys Selma Lagerlöf efter att ha fått en uppsats publicerad i Vimmerby Tidning – där hon senare också får arbete som volontär. Efter två år på tidningen slutar hon. Astrid är arton år och gravid, hon vill inte leva sitt liv med barnafadern och hon vill inte stanna i Vimmerby.\r\n\r\nEtt nytt liv börjar\r\nAstrid lämnar Vimmerby och skapar sig ett liv i Stockholm där hon utbildar sig till stenograf och maskinskriverska. Färdigheter hon skulle komma att få stor nytta av senare i livet.\r\n\r\nGenom arbetet som sekreterare på Kungliga Automobilklubben träffar Astrid 1928 sin blivande man, kontorschefen Sture Lindgren. Sture är en sällskapsmänniska, humoristisk och vänlig, och umgås gärna i glada vänners lag. Det händer att Astrid deltar i utelivet, men stannar lika gärna hemma med en god bok. Kärleken till böcker är något makarna delar, liksom humorn.\r\n\r\nEfter kriget blir det möjligt att resa ut i Europa igen, och Astrid följer gärna med Sture på hans arbetsresor. Ibland i bil med kollegorna och vännerna Hedner (varken Sture eller Astrid hade körkort!).\r\n\r\nDen lilla lägenheten på Vulcanusgatan blir snart för trång för familjen som nu består av Astrid och Sture och de två barnen Lasse och Karin. 1941 går flytten till den våning på Dalagatan där Astrid kommer att bo livet ut. Från fönstret i vardagsrummet kan man se ut över Vasaparken på andra sidan gatan och dit går Astrid och barnen ofta för att klättra i träd, gunga och åka kana. Astrid “var inte som andra mammor” utan är gärna med själv i lekarna. På somrarna är familjen i Furusund i Stockholms skärgård, den plats på jorden Astrid älskade mest. Det är här hon inspireras till berättelserna om Saltkråkan.\r\n\r\nDubbla roller – förlagsredaktören och författaren\r\nNär den första boken om Pippi Långstrump kommer ut på förlaget Rabén & Sjögren 1945 förändras Astrids liv. Boken blir en stor framgång, älskad av barn och vuxna världen över.\r\n\r\nNågot år senare börjar hon arbeta som barnboksredaktör på Rabén & Sjögren och blir snart ansvarig för barnboksutgivningen. Sina egna böcker stenograferar hon, fram till halv tolv på förmiddagen, i sängen hemma på Dalagatan. På eftermiddagen blir hon barnboksredaktör Lindgren och ägnar sig åt att träffa författare och illustratörer på förlaget, redigera manus och ta ställning till utgivningen. Hon stannar på Rabén & Sjögren fram till pensionen 1970.\r\n\r\nLivet under 50- och 60-talen är intensivt. Astrid Lindgren blandar ett produktivt författarskap med sin roll som barnboksförläggare. Hon hinner dessutom med mängder av officiella framträdanden, boklanseringar, filmpremiärer och ett rikt privatliv med familj och vänner.\r\nVid påsktiden 1950 blir Sture sjuk. Han avlider 1952, bara femtiotre år gammal.\r\n\r\nEn röst i samhällsdebatten\r\nFrån att ha levt som en vanlig hemmafru är Astrid Lindgren nu världsberömd författare. En berömmelse vars baksida är att ofta behöva stå i rampljuset. Det, för Astrid helt nödvändiga, privata livet får allt mindre utrymme, och många gånger önskar hon att hon kunde slippa all uppmärksamhet. Trots det sätter hon 1976 igång en debatt om skattepolitiken som medverkar till att fälla den socialdemokratiska regeringen, efter fyrtio år i maktposition.\r\n\r\nDet är första gången Astrid med kraft ger sig in i samhällsdebatten – men inte den sista. Två år senare får hon de tyska bokhandlarnas fredspris och hennes tacktal vid prisutdelningen blir startskottet för en internationell debatt om aga i barnuppfostran. Hon tar aktivt ställning för Nej-sidan i den svenska folkomröstningen om kärnkraft 1980 och engagerar sig en kampanj mot oetisk djurhållning, vilket senare leder till ny djurskyddslag.\r\n\r\nVid nittioett års ålder drabbas Astrid Lindgren av en stroke och får allt svårare att röra sig och delta i offentliga sammanhang. I januari 2002 avlider Astrid Lindgren i sitt hem på Dalagatan. Begravningen hålls den åttonde mars, på internationella kvinnodagen. Stockholms gator är fulla av människor som följer kistans färd genom staden på väg mot Storkyrkan i Gamla stan.\r\n\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nSwedish writer of fiction for children and young adults, most famous for Pippi Longstocking, Karlsson-on-the-roof and Emil\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.astridlindgren.com/manniskan/kort-biografi"
